The DivingTowerSimulator emits his output w/ events so that any UI can be layed on top of the simulation.
For this UI to work, the Manager handles the subscribtion of the ConsoleOutput class which prints the outputs to the console.

The Simulation works in combination of a Timer that runs every 100 milliseconds that the DivingTowerSimulator subscribes to.
The DivingTowerSimulator will work with Timestamps and aa constant check if the Timestamps are smaller than the current date.
The Simulation parameters are set as constants in the ENUM_AND_CONSTANTS class.
DivingTowerSimulator emits an event when the simulation has ended.
